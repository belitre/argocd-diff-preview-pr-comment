A Go CLI application that processes ArgoCD application diffs from [argocd-diff-preview](https://github.com/dag-andersen/argocd-diff-preview), splits them by application, and posts organized comments on GitHub pull requests. This tool helps teams review ArgoCD changes more effectively by providing clear, application-specific diff summaries directly in PR comments.

## Features

- 🚀 Process ArgoCD application diffs
- 📦 Split diffs by application for better organization
- 💬 Post structured comments on GitHub PRs
- 🎯 Configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
- 🔧 Built with Go for performance and reliability
- 📊 Comprehensive test coverage
- 🏗️ Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Installation

### Download Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/belitre/argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment/releases).

Available architectures:
- Linux (amd64, arm64)
- macOS (arm64)
- Windows (amd64)

### Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**
- Go 1.25.7 or higher
- Make

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/belitre/argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment.git
cd argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment

# Build for current platform
make build

# Or build for all supported platforms
make build-cross

# The binaries will be in the ./build directory
```

## Usage

### Post Diffs to GitHub Pull Requests

The `add` command posts split ArgoCD diffs as comments to a GitHub PR:

```bash
# Basic usage with environment variable
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment add \
  --diff-file path/to/diff.txt \
  --pr-ref owner/repo#123

# Using full GitHub PR URL
argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment add \
  --diff-file path/to/diff.txt \
  --pr-ref https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 \
  --github-token ghp_your_token_here

# Dry-run to preview without posting
argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment add \
  --diff-file path/to/diff.txt \
  --pr-ref owner/repo#123 \
  --dry-run

# Custom size limit and rate limiting
argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment add \
  --diff-file path/to/diff.txt \
  --pr-ref owner/repo#123 \
  --max-length 32768 \
  --max-retries 5 \
  --retry-delay 3s \
  --backoff-factor 2.5
```

### Split Diffs (Analysis Only)

The `split` command analyzes and logs split parts without posting:

```bash
# Split and analyze a diff file
argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment split \
  --diff-file path/to/diff.txt \
  --max-length 65536
```

### General Commands

```bash
# Show version and help
argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment --help
argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment version

# Run with custom log level
argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment --log-level debug version

# Available log levels: debug, info, warn, error, fatal
```

### Command-line Flags

#### Add Command (Post to GitHub)

- `--diff-file`: Path to the ArgoCD diff file (required)
- `--pr-ref`: GitHub PR reference in format `owner/repo#123` or full URL (required)
- `--github-token`: GitHub personal access token (optional if using env vars)
- `--max-length`: Maximum length of each comment in bytes (default: 65536)
- `--max-retries`: Maximum number of retry attempts for rate limits (default: 3)
- `--retry-delay`: Initial delay between retries (default: 2s)
- `--backoff-factor`: Exponential backoff multiplier (default: 2.0)
- `--request-timeout`: HTTP request timeout (default: 30s)
- `--dry-run`: Preview actions without posting comments (default: false)
- `--log-level`: Log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal) (default: "info")

#### Split Command (Analysis Only)

- `--diff-file`: Path to the ArgoCD diff file (required)
- `--max-length`: Maximum length of each split part in bytes (default: 65536)
- `--log-level`: Log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal) (default: "info")

### Rate Limiting

The tool automatically handles GitHub API rate limits:

- **Detection**: Monitors `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable parameters
- **Default Behavior**: 3 retries with 2s initial delay and 2.0x backoff factor
- **Comment Delay**: 500ms delay between posting comments to avoid rate limits

When rate limited, the tool will:
1. Wait for the time specified in the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header
2. Retry the request with exponential backoff
3. Log detailed information about rate limit status

### CI/CD Integration Example

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Post ArgoCD Diff to PR
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    argocd-diff-preview-pr-comment add \
      --diff-file argocd-diff.txt \
      --pr-ref ${{ github.repository }}#${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

## Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope (for posting PR comments)
- `GH_TOKEN`: Alternative environment variable for GitHub token (if `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not set)

The GitHub token can also be provided via the `--github-token` flag. If no token is provided through any method, the application will exit with an error.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25.7 or higher
- Make
- GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope

### Available Make Targets

```bash
make help          # Show all available targets
make build         # Build for current platform
make build-cross   # Build for all supported platforms
make test          # Run tests with verbose output
make fmt           # Format code
make lint          # Run linter
make coverage      # Generate coverage report
make clean         # Remove build artifacts
make tidy          # Run go mod tidy
make all           # Run fmt, lint, test, and build-cross
```

### Development Workflow

1. Make code changes following the [code style guidelines](docs/CLAUDE.md#code-style)
2. Run `make fmt` to format code
3. Run `make lint` to check for issues
4. Run `make test` to verify tests pass
5. Run `make coverage` to ensure adequate test coverage
6. Run `make build` to verify compilation
7. Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Generate coverage report
make coverage

# View coverage in browser
open build/coverage.html
```

## CI/CD Workflows

### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Triggered on:
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`
- Pushes to `main` or `develop`

Actions:
1. **Test and Lint Job**:
   - Runs `make tidy` and checks for uncommitted changes
   - Runs `make fmt` and verifies formatting
   - Runs `make lint` to check code quality
   - Runs `make test` to execute all tests
   - Runs `make coverage` to generate coverage reports
   - Runs `make build` to verify local compilation
   - Uploads coverage reports as artifacts

2. **Cross-platform Build Job**:
   - Runs `make build-cross` to build for all platforms
   - Uploads all binaries as artifacts

Both jobs cache Go dependencies for faster builds.

### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

Triggered on:
- Pushes to `main` branch

Actions:
1. Runs `make test` and `make lint`
2. Uses [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) to:
   - Analyze commit messages (follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/))
   - Determine the next version number
   - Generate release notes
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Builds binaries for all platforms using `make build-cross`
4. Packages binaries as `.tar.gz` and `.zip` files
5. Uploads all archives to the GitHub release

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` → Minor version bump (new features)
- `fix:` → Patch version bump (bug fixes)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Major version bump
- Other types: `docs:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`

**Example Commits:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for multiple repositories"
git commit -m "fix: handle empty diff responses correctly"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
```

### Caching Strategy

Both workflows cache:
- Go modules (`~/go/pkg/mod`)
- Go build cache (`~/.cache/go-build`)

Cache key is based on `go.sum` content, ensuring dependencies are only re-downloaded when they change.
